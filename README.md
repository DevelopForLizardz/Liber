# Liber
GUI application for downloading YouTube videos.

If using the executables:

All you have to do is just __download__ the appropriate executable based on your operating system and voila! Run that sucker to your hearts content.

If using the source code:

Liber requires these packages:

__Pafy__

__Pydub__ 

__mutagen__

__youtube-dl__

and __ffmpeg__

All of these, except __ffmpeg__ can be installed using __Pip__ or just by executing __setup.py__. __Ffmpeg__, on the other hand, needs to be installed by using __apt-get install ffmpeg__,
however if you are using Ubuntu 14.04, you might need to execute __sudo add-apt-repository ppa:mc3man/trusty-media && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade__ first, in order to give apt a source.

In all honesty this program is pretty terrible in its current state and lacking features, however this is my first attempt at someting like this. Over time this program will improve as I start improving as well, so patience is very much asked for.
